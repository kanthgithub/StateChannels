# StateChannels in Ethereum

- Intro (101):

```
State channels are a very broad and simple way to think about blockchain interactions which could occur on the blockchain,
but instead get conducted off of the blockchain, without significantly increasing the risk of any participant.
The most well known example of this strategy is the idea of payment channels in Bitcoin,
which allow for instant fee-less payments to be sent directly between two parties.

State channels are the general form of payment channels,
applying the same idea to any kind of state-altering operation normally performed on a blockchain.
